# Graph-Theory-Project

# Research & Development
#### Start of Semester to 04-03-19
Each week I watched the various videos posted and read the Python documents, along with researching online to get a grasp of the language. This has really helped me with this project and will be a vauable skill going forward in my career.

#### Week of 04-03-19 to 04-03-19
I intially began to look up related information online that could help me. I also watched the videos and read the information posted on Learnonline regarding the project. From this I developed a function in Python that converts Infix notation to Postfix, which is the first step of the project.

# Project Plan
* Week 1 - Initial research, setup of project and implementation of Infix to Postfix conversion.
* Week 2 - Working with strings, and creating small NFA's from parts of the regular expression in Python. These would then build and overall larger NFA.
* Week 3 - Main functionality and testing.
* Week 4 - Adding finishing touches, tidying up code, and adding extras.
